1. Why do I need to import the layout in book pages? This means gatsby is repainting the entire page again? 
2. Why gatsby needs to fetch page-data.json  files that contain static content? The goal of the build is not to generate the static html elements?
3. [Server side rendering in Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/using-gatsby-image/#avoid-hydration-lag-for-react-apps)
> Because Gatsby does server rendering during the build process (rather than when a user is loading the page)
4. Read https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/
5. Read https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/data-fetching/ and https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/conceptual/react-hydration/
6. I can't query allBooksJson unless I have at least one book in the collection, bc if not the schema isn't created. How can I avoid this?
   Maybe I need to define the schema before? https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/schema-generation/ & https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/ & https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/graphql-data-layer/schema-customization/#creating-type-definitions
   But seems a lot of work bc I need to replicate the schema that is infered from the transformer-json plugin
7. How can I use autogenerated uuid for elements in the collection? (not only book but quote as well)
