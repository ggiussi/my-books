- deploy to netlify
- create pages from json
- use markdown in json (see if I can use this plugin although seems to be tested with tina gatsby-plugin-json-remark)
- use a CMS (netlifyCMS or tina)
- try tina (https://tina.io/docs/integrations/gatsby/)
- find if I can't use subdomains from my domain, so I only pay for one domain and everyone can have their site in ggiussi-my-books.slank.com.
- can I have reference between collections? maybe in a different CMS
- check strapi (api based cms) https://strapi.io/blog/build-a-static-blog-with-gatsby-and-strapi
